# Pipeline Example with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps

This repository contains an api rest developed in SpringBoot to exemplify how to set up a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps.

## Description

A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing and deploying software, ensuring that changes to the code are quickly tested and deployed to production. This example demonstrates how to set up a basic pipeline for a web application.

## Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions:** An automation tool integrated into GitHub to set up CI/CD pipelines.
- **Azure DevOps:** A Microsoft DevOps services platform, including build and release pipelines.

## Configuration

### GitHub Actions

1. **Workflow configuration:**
   - In the `.github/workflows` folder, you'll find the YAML files that define the workflows of the pipeline with GitHub Actions.

2. **Customization
   - Customize the YAML files according to the needs of your project, modifying the build, test and deployment steps.

### Azure DevOps

1. **Pipeline configuration
   - Access Azure DevOps and create a new pipeline.
   - Connect your GitHub account to Azure DevOps to import the repository.
   - Follow the instructions to set up a build and release pipeline.

2. **Agent configuration
   - If necessary, configure build agents.
